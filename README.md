Welcome to my Valify internship showcase! This repository highlights the key projects I worked on during my internship, demonstrating my skills in AI-driven data analysis and content generation for the healthcare spend management sector.

## Internship Overview

My primary role was to generate rich LLM narratives for Valify's website, focusing on creating detailed descriptions for thousands of vendors and categories in their spend categorization platform.

## Skills and Technologies

- Python (including pandas for data manipulation)
- AI prompting techniques (XML tags, Anthropic-specific methods, temperature optimization, multi-shot prompting, system prompt optimization)
- SQL and PostgreSQL
- AWS services (Bedrock, Session Manager, boto3)
- Linux shell and Windows command prompt
- Git and GitHub
- Bedrock Converse API and InvokeModel API
- Python virtual environments
- Jupyter Notebook
- AutoHotkey for efficient data entry

## Projects

This showcase includes two main projects:

1. [Category Summaries](./category-summaries/): Generating concise descriptions for Valify's hospital spend analysis categories.
2. [Vendor Summaries](./vendor-summaries/): Extracting and summarizing key information from vendor websites.

Each project folder contains its own README with detailed information about the project's goals, implementation, and outcomes.

## Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, I gained extensive experience in:

- Advanced LLM prompting techniques
- Efficient data processing with Python and pandas
- SQL query optimization
- AWS cloud services integration
- Collaborative software development practices
- Version control with Git
- Documentation and README creation

This internship provided invaluable hands-on experience in applying AI, data analysis, and software development techniques to real-world business challenges in the healthcare industry.
